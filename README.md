### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is William Ko

I am a first year student at the University of British Columbia with intentions on specializing in Computer Science

My skills include JavaScript, Java, C++, Python, CSS, HTML, and PHP (it has been a while though so I am a tad rusty and will need to review XD)

Looking forward to working with you! Feel free to email me at ko.william.robert@gmail.com or follow me on Instagram @williamrobert2004
