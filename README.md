### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is William Ko

I am a third year student at the University of British Columbia currently majoring in Cognitive Systems: Brain and Cognition stream

My skills include JavaScript, Java, C++, Python, CSS, HTML, and PHP

I am someone with **Autism Spectrum Disorder**, but I don't see it as a weakness but as someone that has a unique perspective on life and on projects.

Below are all my projects that I have worked on in the past that I was unable to load into my GitHub as code, but wanted to save these projects as they were still a part of my coding history and development.

I also worked on some Code.org projects as some of my earliest games (below are my highschool projects). All my university projects are in their own repositories below

TriviaTerra: This trivia game was made as the final project for my AP Computer Science Principles Course

Keys and Riddles: A digital riddle room that is not what it seems...

The Mage's Eye: Another project made in AP Computer Science Principles that I upgraded to make it more fun
